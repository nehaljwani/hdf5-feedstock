  patches:
    # Patches the test suite to skip the cache, cache_image, and fheap tests
    # This test has been found to rather resource intensive.
    # In particular, it caused Travis CI's Mac builds to hang.
    # Given that we simply skip the test on all platforms.
    - test_Makefile.in.patch
    # Disable shared Fortran API building on OSX
    - osx_configure.patch  # [osx]

build:
  number: 2
  run_exports:
    # hdf5 has historically broken API between bugfix revisions.  Pin it to be safe.
    #    This pinning is using the implicitly defined output for the top-level recipe.
    #    We use pin_subpackage here so that we have more control over the pinning.
    - {{ pin_subpackage('hdf5', min_pin='x.x.x', max_pin='x.x.x') }}

requirements:
  build:
    - {{ compiler('c') }}
    - {{ compiler('cxx') }}
    - {{ compiler('fortran') }}
    - libtool        # [unix]
    - cmake >=3.1
  host:
    - zlib

# no explicit run deps.  zlib is one, and C/C++/Fortran runtimes are others, but these are taken care of
#   with conda-build 3's run_exports in those packages.  They will be run reqs in the final package.  See
#   for yourself by running conda render on this recipe.
